## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.80 ONLY if the item clearly involves electrophysiology or physiological time series
  (EEG/MEG/LFP/iEEG/ECoG/neuronal spiking) OR aperiodic/1/f, oscillations, waveform shape,
  spectral parameterization, or neuronal timescales — OR introduces a general time-series/signal
  processing method that would transfer to those data.

If it is primarily about drugs/behavior/psychiatric symptoms without neural/physio time-series analysis,
  cap score at 0.40.

If it is primarily microbiology/immunology/metabolism/genetics without neural dynamics methods,
  cap score at 0.25. -->

## narrative
I'm a PhD student broadly researching signatures of sleep-related memory consolidation, consciousness, intra-region/inter-region/inter-brain oscillatory coherence and coupling, and cognition in human electrophysiology data, namely scalp/intracranial eeg as well as acute neuropixels in humans. I aim to learn a broad range of theories, approaches, findings, and methods to help me construct my thesis resesarch project.
