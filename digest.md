<p>by Verna Heikkinen, Susanne Merz, Riitta Salmelin, Sampsa Vanhatalo, Leena Lauronen, Mia Liljeström, Hanna Renvall</p> Human brain dynamics are highly unique between individuals: functional neuroimaging studies have recently described functional features that can be used as neural fingerprints. However, the stability of these fingerprints is affected by aging and disease. As such, the stability of brain fingerprints may be a useful metric when studying normal and pathological neurodevelopment…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Mental imagery provides a unique window into the brain's ability to internally simulate sensory experiences, offering valuable insights for both cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface (BCI) research. This study examined the neural representations of imagined auditory and visual stimuli using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and assessed the ability of machine learning models to decode these mental processes. MEG data were recorded from 18 right-handed participants during auditory and vi…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a cornerstone of human brain research, yet its interpretation is complicated by its sensitivity to the slow hemodynamic response that obscures the organization of neural activity across faster time scales. Here we use simultaneous wide-field optical imaging (WOI) and rs-fMRI to directly examine the relationship between neural and hemodynamic functional connectomes across time scales. We show that much of the large-scale spatial structure is preserved acr…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Thalamocortical circuits play a fundamental role in cognitive functions, and neural synchronization, with disruptions implicated in disorders. Here, we investigated the neural dynamics of thalamocortical connectivity using computational modeling of rodent and primate thalamocortical loops. We incorporated distinct projections and varying network configurations and examined their impact on circuit synchrony, spiking patterns, and sleep spindle generation. Circuits included distinct core and matri…

<p><i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a serotonergic psychedelic that is being investigated for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Although the neurophysiological effects of DMT in humans are well characterized, similar studies in animal models and data on the neurochemical effects of DMT are generally lacking, which are critical for a mechanistic understanding. Here, we combined behavioral analysis, high-density (32-channel) electroencephalography, and ultrahigh-performance liqu…

## [The Spatial Coding of Touch Is Defined in Intrinsic, Limb-Specific Coordinates: An EEG Study](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/46/5/e1089252025?rss=1)
*Journal of Neuroscience current issue*  
Score: **0.75**

Tags: EEG, tactile remapping, neural dynamics

This EEG study explores tactile remapping, linking neural activity with perceptual experiences, relevant to neural time series analysis.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>The brain computes the spatiotopic position of touch by integrating tactile and proprioceptive signals (i.e., tactile remapping). While it is often assumed that the spatiotopic touch location is mapped into extrinsic, limb-independent coordinates, an alternative view proposes that touch is remapped into intrinsic, limb-specific coordinates. To test between these hypotheses, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and a novel tactile stimulation paradigm in which participants (<i>N</i> = 20, 19 f…

<p>by Tsukushi Kamiya, Mircea T. Sofonea, Michael France, Nicolas Tessandier, Ignacio G Bravo, Carmen Lia Murall, Jacques Ravel, Samuel Alizon</p> The vaginal microbiota is associated with the health of women and newborns alike. Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human microbiota systems, the mechanisms underpinning the dynamics and stability of vaginal microbial communities remain elusive. A crucial, yet so far underexplored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is t…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>To encode a cognitive map of an environment, a navigator must be able to integrate across perceptual views corresponding to the same place. This can be done in two ways: first, by integrating across the panorama of views obtainable at a single vantage point, and second, by integrating across views of a distal location containing a landmark that is visible from multiple vantage points. We tested the hypothesis that these two viewpoint integration processes are mediated by different neuroanatom…
